# Collection python challenges  

The main idea here is to compare different approaches  
It's not about who's is the best but to learn from each other  

The repository contains a directory for each challenge  
Feel free to contribute your versions to the assigned directories  

Once a challenge is completed by everyone we can have a revision  
We could vote on what the best approach was and feature this version  

Any suggestions can be added to the SUGGESTIONS.md  

### How to contribute  
1. Change directory to the correct challenge  
2. Paste your challenge and suffix your name  
3. Add and commit your file with appropriate message  
4. Push the commit upstream  

Remember: "git pull master" will update your directory with latest commits  

### Commit & message convention  
Try to follow these simples rules when making a commit:  
+ One file per commit, try to avoid committing multiple files at once  
+ Start the commit message with the name of the challenge (directory)  
+ Use the keywords ADD and EDIT according (UPPERCASE)  
+ All lowercase for consistency (except for keywords)  
+ Hyphenate challenge names (hello-world)  
+ Finish the message with your name  

Message exmples: "allergies ADD wesley" "largest-series-product EDIT jef"  

### RULES  
1. **Stick to the commit convention**  
2. **Only push challenges that have passed the test**  
3. **No editing or deleting anyone else's work without consent**
